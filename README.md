Alloy an OpenSource hardware fusion of FPGA and Cortex M7 Microcontroller in a [BlackEdge](https://github.com/folknology/BlackEdge) compatible layout, a project of the myStorm communtiy.

Current status is hardware design, you can see the developments we are making on my regular streams :
*  [Live Stream, 8pm BST](https://www.twitch.tv/folknology)
* [Historic streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79OoLG_Dxk0&list=PLXS9jyX9czzodpJNL-szsMfl0rOrZk4B7)
Or at the join us at the [myStorm community forum](https://forum.mystorm.uk)

We will be using an Alloy fusion framework on top of [nMigen](https://github.com/m-labs/nmigen) and [Circuit Python](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython)
